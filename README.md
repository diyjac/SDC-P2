# SDC-P2
German Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## NOTES
1. Please contact me if you wish to get the 2GB modelv3.ckpt session save files, or the 4GB modelv4.ckpt session files.  They are too large to include for github.
2. If you want to see previous attempts on candidate models 1, 2, and 4, please review the saved notebooks under "attempts" folder.
3. The 5 new US traffic sign images are both under the "newimages" folder in github as well as in the new_us_traffic_signs.tar.gz archive.
4. Let me know if a stand-alone evaluator/recognizer is desirable.
5. Not all cells are executed for the final project Jupyter notebook.  This is because I had to re-start the notebook multiple times due to crashes in CUDA when tuning the parameters for the 3 inception modules model, candidate model 4.  They are not needed for the final project, but are included to show the iterative modeling and the success achieved during the 3 weeks of the project.  If necessary, I can remove the unexecuted cells.

Cheers,
John.
